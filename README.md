ADDITIONAL FEATURES AND WORK I WOULD NEED TO DO IN THE FUTURE:

•	I would need to add in a way for users to only be able to view their contacts only. I ran out of time trying to work in the logic statements.

•	I would like to add a way for the users list to automatically be listed by alphabet.

•	I would also like to add in a search mechanism as well. 

•	I would also like to work on styling.

•	I would like to add a Learn More page.

•	I would also like to edit spelling errors on the page.

•	I would like to additionally add a way for users to be able to connect to LinkedIn and add contacts that way as well.
